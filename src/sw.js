/** 
 * Install the service worker and open the cache. 
 * 
 * Note #1: The service worker only caches what has been served at the 
 * time of install. If further files (css, html, js, images, etc.) are 
 * intended to be served at a later time this method should be modified 
 * to cache those files as well in a dynamic manner. In larger apps it is 
 * common to use a build tool to generate a list of files to cache at build 
 * time, since the file names are generally hashed.
 * 
 * Note #2: The service worker will not allow installation if the server
 * is not running on HTTPS with a trusted certificate. Localhost/127.0.0.1
 * and file:// are exceptions. However with file:// CORS will need to be
 * dealt with.
